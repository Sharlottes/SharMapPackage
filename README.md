# What is SharMapPackage?
you can download these maps, and import in mindustry. that's all!   
this package includes attack, survival, pvp maps, but not td, overed, old maps.   
these maps are not fully completed maps, it means it's possible it's updated anytime. also you can see the history on Commits.

## What is td, overed map?
TD map can work on server which has tower-defense server .jar file.   
overed map is not funny, over-balanced, too big or small attack map. so.. i don't recommend this map to you.

## is there server having this map?
yes, but not have all of.
sometimes server user or admin(moderator) download my maps, and post their own server.   
ECAN, IO, KR, RU, ATANNER, TWS.. etc servers have my maps.   
please remind the server can't have the newest maps always.
